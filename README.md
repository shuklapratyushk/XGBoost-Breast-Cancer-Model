Predicts breast cancer diagnosis from lab results using XGBoost and explains model predictions with SHAP. Looking forward to making this interactive with Streamlit.

## Folder Structure

- `data/` – Raw and processed datasets (ignored in Git)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks: cleaning, EDA, training, SHAP
- `outputs/` – Figures and model artifacts (ignored in Git)
- `src/` – Optional Python scripts for reusable code

## Usage

1. Open `notebooks/01-data-cleaning.ipynb` to prepare data
2. Explore features in `02-eda.ipynb`
3. Train model in `03-train-xgboost.ipynb`
4. Interpret model with `04-shap-explainability.ipynb`
